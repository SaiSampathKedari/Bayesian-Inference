# Bayesian Inference

This repository is about **learning unknown parameters from data under uncertainty** using Bayesian inference.

It focuses on how prior assumptions, likelihood models, and observed data combine to form posterior distributions, and how inference behaves in practical and challenging settings.

**Topics (in progress):**
- Bayesian parameter estimation
- Posterior distributions and uncertainty
- MAP and posterior mean estimation
- Sampling-based inference (MCMC)
- Identifiability and prior sensitivity
- Practical diagnostics and failure cases

🚧 This repository is under active development. Code, experiments, and explanations will be added step by step.

## About Me

I am interested in **probabilistic methods for robots**, with an emphasis on **state estimation, control, and uncertainty quantification**.
